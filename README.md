Our project is built on top of the Infinigen codebase. We wrote all our files in `cs231n-project/infinigen/primitive_builder`. 
Please check the `agents` folder for each agent's implementation and `full_agent.py` for the full implementation. 
`decomposed_agent.py` and `direct_primitive_agent.py` are incomplete versions of `full_agent.py` used for comparison.

### üõ† Steps for generating 3D scene
#### 1. Clone this repo
#### 2. Follow the official Infinigen repository for installation and setup: https://github.com/princeton-vl/infinigen 
#### 3. Setup OpenAI API Key
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=‚ÄôYOUR-KEY‚Äô 
```
Visit the OpenAI Platform website to generate your API key.

#### 4. Run `full agent`
```bash
python primitive_builder/full_agent.py "DESCRIPTION" "CUSTOM_PATH_1" "CUSTOM_PATH_2"
```
This line generates a `DESCRIPTION` furniture, with the pre-validator version saved at custom path `"CUSTOM_PATH_1"` and the post-validator version saved at custom path `"CUSTOM_PATH_2"`. An example of the DESCRIPTION would be: "A round table with two candles on top of it."
